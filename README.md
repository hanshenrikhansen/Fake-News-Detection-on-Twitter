The rise of social media has transformed global communication, enabling real-time 
information sharing while also facilitating the rapid spread of misinformation and fake news. 
This study addresses the critical need for effective and scalable fake news detection on 
platforms like Twitter. The aim is to develop and compare various machine learning and 
deep learning models to classify tweets as either representing fake or real news. A 
combination of traditional classifiers, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest, 
as well as a deep learning-based Bidirectional LSTM (biLSTM) model is applied. These 
models are trained and evaluated using two text representation techniques: TF-IDF and pre
trained Word2Vec embeddings. Emphasis is placed on optimizing the F1-score to address a 
slight class imbalance and to ensure balanced performance across categories. 
Using the large-scale, fact-checked TruthSeeker2023 dataset comprising over 130,000 
tweets from 2009 to 2022, this study also incorporates exploratory data analysis to uncover 
linguistic patterns in fake versus real content.
